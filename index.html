<p>I made it! I can't believe it! We made it!
I never thought I would understand this coding subject it was a pure struggle to do it as a beginner. Even though I was behind than other students and wanted to just give up, you kept reassuring me that I could learn and I could pass this class and build my own website.
Without your help I wouldn’t have had the basic skills to make a website. Thank you for all your help this year. I never thought this day would come to end but I’m so grateful it has! </p>
